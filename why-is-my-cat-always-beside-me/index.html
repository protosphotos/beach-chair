<p>The most common reasons for a cat to walk in front of you include. Your cat has sized up her options and is conveying that she prefers being with you rather than being by herself in her cat bed. These are the behaviors that dont seem to make any sense. But this isnt always the case and many cat owners find themselves asking why does my cat follow me around everywhere I go.
