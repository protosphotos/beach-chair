<p>Crossposted by 6 minutes ago. My only reason to upgrade from 2020 to 2022 Series chairs was for ChairSFX review purposes. Noticed the mistake when it had been ordered but figured I would simply reject at the door and when I get the return order a Titan. Secretlab list direct pricing and non-direct pricing meaning their products are genuinely cheaper if you buy from their store that you can find by clicking here.
