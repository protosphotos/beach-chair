<p>There are countless different types of leather used on couches today. My cats trashed my last material one when i bought a leather one what i did was put olive oil mixed with lemon juice cats dont like lemon onto a cloth and wiped it over the arms front and sides of the new sofas it discouraged them from thinking it was a huge scratching post and my cats have not trashed this one its a year old also leather is. Leather furniture is sleek soft and durable and doesnt really retain pet odors and hair all of which make it a desirable furniture textile. Keeping cats off furniture is well nigh impossible for most cats and probably not desirable either from the cats point of view.
