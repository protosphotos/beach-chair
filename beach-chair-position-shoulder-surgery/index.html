<p>The SchureMed Powered Beach Chair offers a built-in self-contained motor that doesnt require power from the surgical table allowing for greater positional flexibility in the operating room when proceeding with shoulder surgery such as shoulder arthroscopy. Arthroscopic shoulder surgery can be performed in both the beach chair and lateral decubitus positions. Reduced cerebral perfusion seems to occur frequently during shoulder surgery in the beach chair position BCP primarily in patients under general anesthesia with positive pressure ventilation which may be magnified by deliberate hypotension. The presumed etiology of central nervous system injury is hypotension and subsequent cerebral hypoperfusion that occurs after alterations in positioning under general anesthesia. Approximately two-thirds of the 400000 shoulder surgery procedures performed annually in the United States are performed with the patients head elevated above the horizontal a position know as the beach chair position BCP.</p>
