<p>Why does my cat stare at me. If I get up and walk around the house when it is mealtime I generally have several cats following closely behind me. As well as being a method of communication staring is also a sign of a close bond between you and your cat as they are unlikely to hold eye contact with someone they dont like or trust. But in the end i will be worth it for sure. Why Does My Cat Just Sit And Stare At Me Cat Behavior Cats Cute Cats And Kittens.</p>
