<p><strong>Do Cats Claw Leather Couches</strong>, The furniture may be slightly scratched from their running across it or jumping on it but my experience is that cats dont like to sharpen their claws on leather. People with fabric couches that are damaged over time cant appreciate the urgency when a mere few days of scratching can permanently destroy a couch. A large cat tree with carpetted rope bound and wooden posts plus extra cat scratching posts scattered through the house and especially right by the leather couches will do wonders. Avoid fabrics that snag easily such as tweeds.</p>
