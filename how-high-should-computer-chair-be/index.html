<p>The most commonly seen height of a desk is 735 cm or 29 inches. Perfect if youre 6 feet tall but less than ideal if youre not the average man the office world is designed for. By having the ideal height you can easily reach your workspace and sit comfortably. Corrective Exercise Specialist NASM-CES Certified Personal Trainer NASM-CPT Professional Dancer.

<p>Sitting too high will cause your shoulders to tense up and too low can cause you to slouch unnaturally. The best height range for armrests should be high enough to be level with your desk and low enough to go under the desk. As a rule. You should be able to maintain a forearm-to-upper arm angle between 70 degrees and 135 degrees.

<p>Sitting too high will cause your shoulders to tense up and too low can cause you to slouch unnaturally. Of course if youre taller or shorter youll need to adjust accordingly by using a desk riser block or an adjustable desk. If your desk or materials are too high you should cut it. Your forearms should not bend more than 20 degrees above horizontal when you are sitting.
