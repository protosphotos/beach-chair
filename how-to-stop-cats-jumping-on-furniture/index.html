<p>Remember that your cat is made of time. Cats hate the feel of double-sided tape on their paws so it can be a good deterrent for a cat who continues to jump to a place you dont want her to go. Remember that your cat is made of time. You can stop putting things on that furniture. Pin On Cats.</p>

<p>Its day 5 after spay surgery and my cat wont stop jumping on furniture or cabinets I live in a studio apartment so theres not a room i can put her in at this point i am just watching her closely but i cant stop her 100 of the time from jumping. Tie the string high enough than when the cat jumps up he will trip the string pulling the cans over. After a while he will run when you as much as lift that bottlespraybottle and he will learn to not do it in your presence. The tape can be lightly applied in just a couple of spots to hold it on then when the cat jumps upon it it will stick to his or her paws deterring them from going there again.
