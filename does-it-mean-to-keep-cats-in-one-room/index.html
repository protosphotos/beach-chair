<p>If youre asking if it is okay to keep a cat enclosed in one room with food and water and a litter box pretty much all day for whatever reason then I would say no that is not normal because cats need the opportunity to prowl and explore and stretch their muscles and feel that they own a chunk of territory rather than being boxed up. If you have a closet clear the bottom of it out and try moving their litter box in there with the door open so that they have more space in the main part of the room away from it. If you have more than one cat you will need to double the space. Territory home range. Pin On Cats General.</p>

<p>The smaller the room or the longer the duration of incarceration the crueler it is. My cat is free to roam all over my average-size one-bedroom apartment and seems to spend about 15 hours a day in one specific spot in the living room right by the front door. We all have limits and we learn to live with those limits. Keeping a cat in one room can be a difficult decision.
