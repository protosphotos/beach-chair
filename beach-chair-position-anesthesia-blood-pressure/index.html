<p><strong>Beach Chair Position Anesthesia Blood Pressure</strong>, The difference between the two is the hydrostatic pressure gradient between the brain and the location in which the BP is being measured. During procedures in the BCP or sitting position the head should be secured in a neutral position to avoid flexion or extension. The ﬁrst question is related to the safe lower limit. In any upright position including the beach chair position the blood pressure BP measured in the arm will be higher than the BP in the brain.</p>
