Brain Tumor Study Raises Cell Phone Concerns In England Cnn From cnn.com</p>
<p>There are studies regarding laptop use when the laptop is sitting in the users lap. It involved more than 12800 people worldwide including over 5000 with brain tumours. DNA is the chemical that makes up our genes which control how our cells function. They operate at frequencies between 450 and 2700 MHz with peak powers in the range of 01 to 2 watts1 Concerns have been raised that mobile phones cause cancer - specifically brain tumours as they are held close to the head when they are used.</p>

<p>They based their statement on findings that using a cell phone for 10 years doubles the risk of developing a form of cancerous brain tumor called a glioma the same type that killed Ted Kennedy. If this behavior could produce brain cancer I would now have at least 2 pounds worth of brain tumors. In addition a French study released this week found that heavy cell phone use increased the risk of glioma and other types of brain tumors.

<p>These are tumours where the tumour cells grow more rapidly and are more likely to spread within the brain. Some research suggests a slight increase in the rate of brain tumors since the 1970s but cellphones werent in use during the 1970s.
