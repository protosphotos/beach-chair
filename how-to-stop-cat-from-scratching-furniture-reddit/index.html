<p>Sometimes when I am petting my cat or shes in a space with a lot of peoplenoise her eyes get very wide and she starts droolingSometimes she also breathes very rapidly. There are also ones made out of sisal others made out of cardboard. Try horizontal and vertical scratching posts. Once thats consistent for a few weeks you can move the post and theyll go to it.
