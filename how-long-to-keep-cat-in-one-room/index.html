<p><strong>How Long To Keep Cat In One Room</strong>, So now you know how long you can expect for this. On average a new cat may stay in the Bonding Room for 2 - 7 days but generally the cat will let you know when he is ready for the next step. Practice patience until your kitty is ready to interact with everyone else. I totally believe that how long it takes a cat to settle into depends on each individual cat its personality and its circumstances.</p>

<p>It also depends on how long the cat is kept in a single room. If you have more than one cat you will need to double the space. A tiny room like a bathroom or laundry room with at least a litter box a hidey holebed and feeding station. This allows the cats to become familiar with each others scents without having to face one other. Set aside a room dedicated to your cat with all he will need eg.</p>
