If your chair doesnt have adequate spine support this will lead to poor posture which stresses the soft tissues and joints in the spine leading to pain. If we sit and shift our weight forward in our desk chair this also increases stress on the soft tissue joints and discs. Symptoms of an MSD due to awkward sitting posture may include muscle fatigue swelling pain numbness or decreased circulation. Best Office Chairs For Hip Pain These Are Just Better Ergonomic Trends.</p>
