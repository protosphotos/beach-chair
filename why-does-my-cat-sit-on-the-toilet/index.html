<p>Cats tend to like cool places so one theory is that tiled rooms are appealing to the furry felines. It doesnt matter the person if theyre on the toilet he wants to sit and get petted and loved on. This can generally mean anything however Cats can feel anxiety so when your on the toilet your most valuable in the cats eyes just like a cat would be at the toilet you notice they check all around them checking for predators so it probably feels comfortable when sitting on your lap. Toilets were not designed for cats and in fact i cant really think of a more unnatural potty experience for a cat than training it.</p>
