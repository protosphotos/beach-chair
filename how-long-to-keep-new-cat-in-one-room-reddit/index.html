He will come to you when you enter the room and will be comfortable in your presence and when he is ready may try to follow you out. How to do basic things like using their litter box how to socialize with the other family members and how to be comfortable in their new environment is reasons to keep the cat isolate in one room.

<p>How long to keep a new cat in one room depends on the individual cat. He will come to you when you enter the room and will be comfortable in your presence and when he is ready may try to follow you out. Indeed when you introduce a new cat to existing cats in a household it is advised that you keep the cat in a room for several days to allow a gentle introduction. This process can take time and 30 days may not be enough for your cat to adjust. 12 Perfectly Timed Animal Photos That Will Make Your Day Funny Cat Pictures Crazy Cats Funny Animals.</p>

<p>Some only need to stay in the new room for a day or two while others may require a week or so. Keep the dog on a leash and have dog treats ready in your pocket. As long as she has access to food water and a litter tray toys to play with and your company she will be fine. While the cats are separated encourage healthy interactions between them.
