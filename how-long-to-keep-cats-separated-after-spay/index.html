<p>This surgical technique typically takes 10 to 14 days for cats to recover from. Female cats often need to be checked 2-3 days and 7-10 days after their operation to make sure they are healing and feeling well. Understand that cats who are in distress &ndash; such as those whove just had surgery &ndash; may try to escape.
