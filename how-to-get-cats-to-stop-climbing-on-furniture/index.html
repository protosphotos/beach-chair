<p>While these kinds of perches are not always in keeping with the general décor of a room putting it off in a remote spot away from you will reduce its value to your kitten. Rubber runners are another option that can save your furniture. However a cat that has little opportunity to walk on hard surfaces may well need its claws trimmed regularly to prevent them from getting too long. Give the cats acceptable alternatives to satisfy their natural instincts of climbing and jumping.

<p>Use a plastic carpet on the furniture to keep your furniture free from dust and prevent cats from using your furniture. Offer your cat hammocks shelves scratching posts and cat condos or cat trees where he can climb for safety and fun. If your cat returns to the furniture and jumps on it say no again and remove her. I would not be in favour of de-clawing the kitten as a cat needs its claws for many purposes other than scratching you and the furniture.
