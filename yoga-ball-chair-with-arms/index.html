<p>It comes in over a dozen colors so you can pick one to match or contrast with your ball chair. There are so many good things about this yoga ball chair that it’s hard to know where to start! A yoga ball chair is a yoga ball placed in a platform with a backrest and in some cases casters to form a chair for people who sit for long periods of time. Our balance ball chairs (some like to call them “yoga ball chairs,” “stability ball chairs,” “exercise ball chairs”—you get the drift) combine our bestselling balance ball with a stabilizing base and a supportive backrest to bring you a fresh way to sit that—wait for it—actually feels good. You Can Still Workout Your Upper Body From a Chair.</p>
